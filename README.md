# persona_ai
Personal project that used AI to analyse a person's persona using their chat histories or a piece of text. My first Github repository

You need to have Node.js to run this application To run, download the code, open the "hr_persona_ai" folder and open the CMD, and then type in "npm install" and then "npm start", if it is done correctly, it should say something ending with "ðŸš€ Server is running at http://localhost:3000" and then, visit http://localhost:3000 for local use.
