# persona_ai
Personal project that used AI to analyse a person's persona using their chat histories or a piece of text. My first Github repository

You need to have Node.js to run this application To run, download the code, open the "hr_persona_ai" folder and open the CMD, and then type in "npm install" and then "npm start", if it is done correctly, it should say something ending with "ðŸš€ Server is running at http://localhost:3000" and then, visit http://localhost:3000 for local use.

I am not 100% sure if "start.bat" could work or not, due to making a new edit after uploading the file, but it should also be a way that chould be used to start running the program.

Also, I forgot to replace my Deepseek API key with a place holder, I will deactivate that API key a few days later, and by then, if you want to use this program, you need to change my deactivated key with your own Deepseek API key.
