# persona_ai
Personal project that used AI to analyse a person's persona using their chat histories or a piece of text. My first Github repository

You need to have Node.js to run this application To run, 
after you download the code, replace the deepseek API key place holder, in "hr_persona_ai\server\analysis.js", with your own Deepseek API key.
open the "hr_persona_ai" folder and open the CMD, and then type in "npm install" and then "npm start", if it is done correctly, it should say something ending with "ðŸš€ Server is running at http://localhost:3000" and then, visit http://localhost:3000 for local use.

I am not 100% sure if "start.bat" could work or not, due to making a new edit after uploading the file, but it should also be a way that chould be used to start running the program.
